Prototype Description:

Our prototype utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze digital content related to financial investments. We extract features like source credibility, and contextual information including sentiment analysis, to identify misleading claims. The prototype also generates responses explaining its decision to flag the content, also clearly demarkating its limitations for legal invincibility. By combining these features, we aim to create a robust and scalable system for detecting and flagging potential financial misinformation.

Tech Stack:
Python
Transformers (BERT, GPT)
TensorFlow/Keras
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook


What I Learned: 

Problem Solving: We learned how to approach complex problems, break them down into manageable tasks, and develop creative solutions.

Technical Skills: We enhanced our technical skills in areas such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, or app design as hackathons provide opportunities to apply and improve existing skills.

Teamwork: We learned the importance of collaborating with diverse team members, learning effective communication, teamwork, and how to leverage the strengths of team members to achieve common goals.

Time Management: We learned to manage our time efficiently, set priorities, and make rapid decisions.

Innovation: Hackathons encourage participants to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions, this helped us gain exposure beyond our comfort zone.
